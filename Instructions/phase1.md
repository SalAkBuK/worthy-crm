1️⃣ MUST-HAVE notifications (no debate)

These directly affect money, accountability, or deadlines.

🔥 Lead lifecycle (core CRM value)

These are non-negotiable for agents + admins

✅ Lead assigned / reassigned (agent)

✅ Lead status changed (admin + CEO summary)

✅ Lead idle for X days (agent + admin)

✅ Follow-up due soon (agent)

✅ Follow-up overdue (agent, escalates to admin after grace period)

Why:
If these don’t exist, the CRM is basically a glorified spreadsheet.

🔥 Follow-ups

✅ Follow-up created / rescheduled (agent)

✅ Missed follow-up auto-flagged (agent, admin)

This enforces discipline without micromanaging.

🔥 Admin / CEO oversight (only the serious ones)

✅ Bulk import failed / partially failed (admin)

✅ Agent deactivated / reactivated (admin + CEO)

✅ Sensitive action audit (delete lead, reopen lead) → admin + CEO

No noise. Only things that matter.
