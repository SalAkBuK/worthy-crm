2️⃣ NICE-TO-HAVE (phase 2, after people actually use it)

These add polish and motivation but aren’t critical.

📈 Agent performance

🟡 Agent closed a deal (agent + admin)

🟡 Agent inactive for X days (admin only)

🟡 KPI threshold reached (weekly, not real-time)

⚠️ Important:
Never real-time spam KPIs. Weekly digest only.


4️⃣ Who gets what (clean rule set)
👤 Agent

Assigned/reassigned lead

Follow-up due / overdue

Missed follow-up

Lead won (their own)

That’s it. No admin noise.

🧑‍💼 Admin

Everything agent-critical +

Idle leads

Bulk import/export status

Agent activation/deactivation

Sensitive actions (delete/reopen)

Admins manage process, not feelings.

👑 CEO

No real-time spam

Only:

Sensitive actions

Agent status changes

Weekly summary (KPIs, wins, idle leads count)

If CEO gets real-time notifications, they’ll ask to turn it all off.
